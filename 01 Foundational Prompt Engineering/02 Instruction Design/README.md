# ‚úçÔ∏è Instruction Design

## üìñ Introduction

**Instruction Design** focuses on writing effective task instructions within prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) toward precise and relevant outputs. In retail, well-designed instructions ensure LLMs perform tasks like customer query answering or product description generation accurately. This guide explores how to craft clear, actionable, and role-specific instructions, with hands-on examples and visualizations, tailored to retail scenarios (April 26, 2025).

## üåü Key Concepts

- **Actionable Instructions**: Use verbs like "list," "describe," or "summarize" to define tasks.
- **Role Specification**: Assign roles (e.g., "retail assistant") for context.
- **Output Constraints**: Specify format (e.g., bullet points) or length (e.g., "in 50 words").
- **Retail Relevance**: Instructions tailored for retail tasks like support or descriptions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Example

Below is a Python example using LangChain to design instructions for a retail customer support task.

```python
# Setup: pip install langchain langchain-openai numpy matplotlib nltk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import numpy as np
import nltk

def run_instruction_design_demo():
    # Synthetic Retail Query Data
    queries = [
        "What is the warranty for the TechCorp laptop?",
        "Can I return the TechCorp smartphone?",
        "How durable is the TechCorp tablet?"
    ]
    print("Synthetic Data: Retail queries created")
    print(f"Queries: {queries}")

    # Instruction-Based Prompt
    llm = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-api-key")  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
    prompt = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["query"],
        template="You are a retail assistant. Answer the customer query in a concise bullet-point list: {query}"
    )
    chain = llm | prompt
    
    responses = [chain.invoke({"query": query}) for query in queries]
    print("Instruction Design: Responses generated")
    for i, (query, response) in enumerate(zip(queries, responses)):
        print(f"Query {i+1}: {query}")
        print(f"Response: {response.strip()}")

    # Visualization
    bullet_counts = [response.count("-") for response in responses]
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    plt.bar(range(1, len(queries) + 1), bullet_counts, color='green')
    plt.title("Number of Bullet Points in Responses")
    plt.xlabel("Query")
    plt.ylabel("Bullet Count")
    plt.savefig("instruction_design_output.png")
    print("Visualization: Bullet counts saved as instruction_design_output.png")

# Execute the demo
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)
    run_instruction_design_demo()
```

## üìä Visualization Output

The code generates a bar chart (`instruction_design_output.png`) showing the number of bullet points in each response, illustrating the impact of instruction design on output structure.

## üí° Retail Applications

- **Customer Support**: Instructions like "Answer in bullet points" ensure clear query responses (e.g., "List return policies for TechCorp smartphone").
- **Product Descriptions**: Instructions like "Describe in 50 words" create concise descriptions (e.g., "Describe TechCorp tablet features").
- **Review Analysis**: Instructions like "Summarize key points" extract insights (e.g., "Summarize TechCorp laptop review").

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. Write an instruction for a retail task with specific output constraints (e.g., "List features in bullet points").
2. Compare responses from detailed vs. vague instructions.
3. Visualize the impact of instructions on response structure (e.g., bullet counts).

## üí° Interview Scenarios

**Question**: How do you design effective task instructions for LLMs?  
**Answer**: Effective instructions are actionable (use verbs like "list"), role-specific (e.g., "retail assistant"), and include output constraints (e.g., "in bullet points").  
**Key**: Clear instructions align LLM outputs with task goals.  
**Example**: `PromptTemplate(template="Answer in a concise bullet-point list: {query}")`

**Coding Task**: Create a prompt with instructions for summarizing a product review in 3 bullet points.  
**Tip**: Use `PromptTemplate` with instructions like "Summarize in 3 bullet points" and test with retail reviews.
