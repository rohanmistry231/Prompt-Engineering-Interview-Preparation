## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Retail Applications** subsection of the **Prompt Engineering Roadmap**! üöÄ This folder applies prompt engineering to retail tasks, including customer support, product descriptions, review analysis, recommendation systems, and inventory queries. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps and supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). This section equips you with skills for retail AI roles using LangChain.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Customer Support**: Prompts for chatbots and query answering.
- **Product Descriptions**: Generating compelling product descriptions.
- **Review Analysis**: Extracting sentiment and insights from reviews.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Prompt-driven product recommendations.
- **Inventory Queries**: Answering stock and pricing questions.
- **Hands-on Code**: Five `.md` files with detailed explanations and code examples using synthetic retail data.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers for retail-focused prompt engineering interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- AI Engineers building retail AI solutions.
- Machine Learning Engineers optimizing LLMs for retail tasks.
- AI Researchers applying prompt engineering to retail.
- Software Engineers deepening expertise in retail LLMs.
- Anyone preparing for AI/ML interviews in retail or tech.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This subsection covers five retail applications of prompt engineering, each with a dedicated `.md` file:

### ü§ù Customer Support (`customer_support.md`)
- Chatbot Prompts
- Query Answering
- Response Visualization

### üìù Product Descriptions (`product_descriptions.md`)
- Compelling Descriptions
- Retail Product Focus
- Description Length Visualization

### üìä Review Analysis (`review_analysis.md`)
- Sentiment Extraction
- Insight Generation
- Sentiment Visualization

### üõçÔ∏è Recommendation Systems (`recommendation_systems.md`)
- Prompt-Driven Recommendations
- Retail Product Suggestions
- Recommendation Relevance Visualization

### üì¶ Inventory Queries (`inventory_queries.md`)
- Stock and Pricing Answers
- Retail Inventory Management
- Query Response Visualization

## üí° Why Master Retail Applications?

Prompt engineering in retail drives business value:
1. **Retail Relevance**: Powers customer support, recommendations, and inventory management.
2. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in retail AI coding challenges.
3. **Efficiency**: Enhances LLM performance for retail tasks.
4. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ AI/ML roles.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Customer Support
  - Day 3-4: Product Descriptions
  - Day 5-6: Review Analysis
  - Day 7: Recommendation Systems
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-2: Inventory Queries
  - Day 3-7: Review `.md` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv prompt_env; source prompt_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install langchain langchain-openai numpy matplotlib pandas nltk rouge-score`.
2. **API Keys**:
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key (replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in code).
   - Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"`.
   - Optional: Use Hugging Face models (`pip install langchain-huggingface huggingface_hub`).
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail data (e.g., queries, reviews, products).
   - Optional: Download datasets from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).
   - Note: Code uses simulated data to avoid file I/O constraints.
4. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.md` files into a Python environment (e.g., `customer_support.py`).
   - Use Google Colab or local setup with GPU support.
   - View outputs in terminal and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies and API keys are set.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Customer Support**:
   - Design a chatbot prompt for retail queries.
   - Visualize response clarity.
2. **Product Descriptions**:
   - Generate a product description prompt.
   - Analyze description lengths.
3. **Review Analysis**:
   - Extract sentiment from retail reviews.
   - Visualize sentiment distribution.
4. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Create a recommendation prompt.
   - Plot recommendation relevance.
5. **Inventory Queries**:
   - Answer stock/pricing queries with prompts.
   - Visualize query response times.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - How do you design prompts for retail chatbots?
  - What makes a compelling product description prompt?
  - How do you extract sentiment from reviews using prompts?
  - How do prompt-driven recommendations work?
  - How do you handle inventory queries with prompts?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain retail prompt design with code (e.g., `PromptTemplate`).
  - Demonstrate sentiment analysis with retail examples.
  - Code tasks like recommendation or inventory query prompts.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., detail vs. conciseness).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Build a retail chatbot prompt.
  - Generate a product recommendation prompt.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain how prompts enhance retail AI.
  - Describe sentiment analysis via prompts.
