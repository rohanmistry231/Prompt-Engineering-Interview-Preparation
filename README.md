- **A/B Testing**: Comparing prompt variations.
- **Error Analysis**: Identifying and fixing prompt failures.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Iterative refinement for optimal results.
- **Latency Optimization**: Reducing response time with concise prompts.

### üõí Retail Applications
- **Customer Support**: Prompts for chatbots and query answering.
- **Product Descriptions**: Generating compelling product descriptions.
- **Review Analysis**: Extracting sentiment and insights from reviews.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Prompt-driven product recommendations.
- **Inventory Queries**: Answering stock and pricing questions.

## üí° Why Master Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is a cornerstone of effective LLM interaction, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Retail Relevance**: Powers customer support, product descriptions, and recommendations.
2. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., prompt design, optimization).
3. **Efficiency**: Achieves high-quality LLM outputs without fine-tuning.
4. **Versatility**: Applicable to diverse tasks in NLP and retail.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ AI/ML roles in retail and tech.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv prompt_env; source prompt_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-huggingface numpy matplotlib pandas nltk rouge-score`.
2. **API Keys**:
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key for LLM access (replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in code).
   - Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"`.
   - Optional: Use Hugging Face models with `langchain-huggingface` (`pip install langchain-huggingface huggingface_hub`).
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail data (e.g., product descriptions, customer queries, reviews).
   - Optional: Download datasets from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) (e.g., Amazon Reviews).
   - Note: `.py` files use simulated data to avoid file I/O constraints.
4. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python prompt_structure.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup with GPU support for faster processing.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
