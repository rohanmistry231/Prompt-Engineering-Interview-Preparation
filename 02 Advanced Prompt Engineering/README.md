## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced Prompt Engineering** subsection of the **Prompt Engineering Roadmap**! üöÄ This folder explores advanced techniques like contextual prompting, dynamic prompting, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt chaining. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps and supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). This section equips you with skills for retail AI roles using LangChain.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Contextual Prompting**: Adding context for task-specific outputs.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Adapting prompts based on input variables.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
- **Self-Consistency**: Generating multiple outputs for consistency.
- **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential prompts for complex tasks.
- **Hands-on Code**: Five `.md` files with detailed explanations and code examples using synthetic retail data.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers for prompt engineering interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- AI Engineers designing sophisticated prompts for retail applications.
- Machine Learning Engineers optimizing LLM interactions.
- AI Researchers mastering advanced prompt techniques.
- Software Engineers deepening expertise in LLMs for retail.
- Anyone preparing for AI/ML interviews in retail or tech.

## üí° Why Master Advanced Prompt Engineering?

Advanced prompt engineering enhances LLM performance for complex tasks:
1. **Retail Relevance**: Improves customer support, reasoning, and multi-step workflows.
2. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., CoT, prompt chaining).
3. **Precision**: Achieves accurate outputs for intricate retail scenarios.
4. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ AI/ML roles.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Contextual Prompting
  - Day 3-4: Dynamic Prompting
  - Day 5-6: Chain-of-Thought
  - Day 7: Self-Consistency
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-2: Prompt Chaining
  - Day 3-7: Review `.md` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv prompt_env; source prompt_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install langchain langchain-openai numpy matplotlib pandas nltk`.
2. **API Keys**:
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key (replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in code).
   - Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"`.
   - Optional: Use Hugging Face models (`pip install langchain-huggingface huggingface_hub`).
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail data (e.g., customer queries, product descriptions).
   - Optional: Download datasets from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).
   - Note: Code uses simulated data to avoid file I/O constraints.
4. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.md` files into a Python environment (e.g., `contextual_prompting.py`).
   - Use Google Colab or local setup with GPU support.
   - View outputs in terminal and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies and API keys are set.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Contextual Prompting**:
   - Add context to retail query prompts.
   - Visualize context impact.
2. **Dynamic Prompting**:
   - Create adaptive prompts for retail tasks.
   - Analyze dynamic response lengths.
3. **Chain-of-Thought**:
   - Design a CoT prompt for retail reasoning.
   - Visualize reasoning steps.
4. **Self-Consistency**:
   - Generate multiple outputs for retail tasks.
   - Plot consistency metrics.
5. **Prompt Chaining**:
   - Build a multi-step retail workflow.
   - Visualize workflow outputs.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:

  - Demonstrate prompt chaining with code (e.g., `SequentialChain`).
  - Code tasks like dynamic prompting or self-consistency.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., complexity vs. accuracy).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Design a CoT prompt for retail query reasoning.
  - Implement a prompt chain for customer support.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain how context enhances LLM performance.
  - Describe self-consistency for output reliability.
